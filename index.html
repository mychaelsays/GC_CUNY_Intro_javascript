        <p> "Animals & Nature" by Y

          The animals are in the sky, trees and the ground.
          The birds take the sky,
          Squirrels are in the trees,
          Wolves are on the ground.
          The animals are in the sky, trees and the ground.
          They are all around.
                    
          Wolves are hunting in the winter.
          Birds are gathering to eat prey.
          Wolves are eating moose.
          Geese are migrating south.
          
          The beauty of nature.
          The birds are singing their songs.
          The beauty of nature.
          The days are getting long.                 </p>
